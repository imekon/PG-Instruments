## PG-SEQ-3 plugin

An implementation of SEQ-3 with 16 steps instead of 8

As this was my first plugin, I took the SEQ-3 plugin and extended it to 16 steps. The front panel is a design from scratch
as per the SEQ-3 license.

## PG Panner

Simple stereo panner, mono in, stereo out. The panner knob sets the panning either fully left or right or centered.

This is a simple cosine/sine panner.

## PG Quad Panner

Quad panner - four mono inputs, each with their own panner and level control. One stereo output mixed from all four inputs.

## PG Oct Panner

Oct (yes 8!) panner, eight mono inputs, each with their own panner and level control. One stereo output mixed from all eight inputs.
